Title: Parse 'NOAA' Integrated Surface Data Files
Description: Tools for parsing 'NOAA' Integrated Surface Data ('ISD') files,
    described at <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd>. Data includes for example,
    wind speed and direction, temperature, cloud data, sea level pressure,
    and more. Includes data from approximately 35,000 stations worldwide,
    though best coverage is in North America/Europe/Australia. Data is stored
    as variable length ASCII character strings, with most fields optional.
    Included are tools for parsing entire files, or individual lines of data.
